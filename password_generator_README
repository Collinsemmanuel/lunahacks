The code you provided is a Python script that defines a function generate_password which can be used to generate random passwords.

The first line # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- is a special comment used to indicate the character encoding used in the script. This is useful when working with non-ASCII characters, such as those in the UTF-8 character set.

The second line """Untitled1.ipynb is a string that serves as a documentation string or docstring for the script. It provides a brief description of the script and the location of the original file.

The import statement is used to import the random and string modules which contain functions and constants needed to generate random passwords.

The generate_password function takes three parameters - length which specifies the length of the password, include_digits which specifies whether to include digits in the password (default is True), and include_symbols which specifies whether to include symbols in the password (default is True).

Inside the function, string.ascii_letters is a string constant that contains all ASCII letters, string.digits is a string constant that contains all digits, and string.punctuation is a string constant that contains all punctuation characters. The chars variable is then defined as a concatenation of these three string constants based on the user's input.

The password variable is then defined as a string containing length number of random characters generated using the random.choice() function that randomly selects characters from the chars string.

Finally, the password string is returned by the function.

The last two lines of code outside the function define a new password and print it. The first line creates a password with a length of 20 characters and assigns it to the variable password. The second line prints the newly generated password.

The last three lines of code define a second password with a length of 10 characters and print it.
