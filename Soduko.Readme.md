This code is an implementation of a backtracking algorithm to solve a Sudoku puzzle.

The Sudoku puzzle is represented as a 9x9 grid of numbers, where each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid must contain the numbers 1 to 9 exactly once. The numbers in the grid are initially filled in partially, and the objective of the algorithm is to fill in the remaining blank cells with numbers that satisfy the constraints.
